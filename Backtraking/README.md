Backtracking is like trying different paths, and when you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last choice and try a different route. In this article, we’ll explore the basics of backtracking, how it works, and how it can help solve all sorts of challenging problems. It’s like a method for finding the right way through a complex choices.


### What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem, like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

### Basic Terminologies
- Candidate: A candidate is a potential choice or element that can be added to the current solution.
- Solution: The solution is a valid and complete configuration that satisfies all problem constraints.
- Partial Solution: A partial solution is an intermediate or incomplete configuration being constructed during the backtracking process.
- Decision Space: The decision space is the set of all possible candidates or choices at each decision point.
- Decision Point: A decision point is a specific step in the algorithm where a candidate is chosen and added to the partial solution.
- Feasible Solution: A feasible solution is a partial or complete solution that adheres to all constraints.
- Dead End: A dead end occurs when a partial solution cannot be extended without violating constraints.
- Backtrack: Backtracking involves undoing previous decisions and returning to a prior decision point.
- Search Space: The search space includes all possible combinations of candidates and choices.
- Optimal Solution: In optimization problems, the optimal solution is the best possible solution.
