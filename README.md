The pivot is put in the position where it it should be when the whole array is sorted
Uses a recursive structure to sort each side split along the index of the pivot
quicksort
 peak - Peak finding algorights for 1D and 2D arrays
Finding an element which is >= to its neighbours
 1D
Implemented using algo similar to Binary Search
 2D
Implemented using algo similar to Binary Search but works in a 2D array
